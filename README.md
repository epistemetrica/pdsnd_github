### Credits
Stack Exchange is soooooo helpful! Udacity's classroom has lots of great info and I'm learning a ton, but the instructions are not quite complete, and I wouldn't have been able to complete the project without stack exchange. 

### Refactoring Branch
I used this branch to fix an actual problem with my project code per request of the reviewer. 
My original code did not ask for the user to see raw data, so this branch was used to add that feature.
